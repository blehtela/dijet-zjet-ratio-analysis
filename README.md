# dijet-zjet-ratio-analysis
This is the analysis code for the investigation of the ratio of the dijet and Z+jet cross section.

The folders in this project contain the following:
- **Dijet_Analysis** &rarr; dijet analysis (header file, main file, simple histogram plotting)
- **Zjet_Analysis** &rarr; Z+jet analysis (header file, main file)
- **Ratios_Dijet_Zjet** &rarr; ratio analysis (plotting of cross section ratios, ratio of ratios - i.e. data xs ratios over MC xs ratios)
- **Plotting** &rarr; plotting scripts (python) for cross sections, ratio plots, trigger plots, etc.
- **H7uncs** &rarr; script for printing relative uncertainties for Herwig 7 sample
- **Tools** &rarr; skimming and attempt to use nanoAODtools (ultimately uncertainties were handled in the big analysis scripts instead)
